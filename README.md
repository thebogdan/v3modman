# v3modman - victoria 3 mod manager

I was watching YouTube video "Victoria 3 Mod List for 1.7.5 with advanced details by An Economist Plays"... it all looked rather tedious & laborious to sort through the mods for preferred load order

Goal is for enthusiasts like An Economist Plays and have something bespoke at their disposal to help optimize mod load order for Victoria 3
